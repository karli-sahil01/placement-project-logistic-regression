# placement-project-logistic-regression
This repository contains my first project aimed at understanding the basic workflow of training a machine learning model. The goal of this project is to implement a simple machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation. It serves as an introduction to key concepts in machine learning.
