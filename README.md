# placement-project-logistic-regression
This repository contains my first project aimed at understanding the basic workflow of training a machine learning model. The goal of this project is to implement a simple machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation. It serves as an introduction to key concepts in machine learning.

Basic Steps:
1. Preprocess + EDA+ Feature Selection 
2. Extract input and output cols 
3. Scale the values 
4. Train test split 
5. Train the model 
6. Evaluate the model/model selection 
7. Deploy the model
